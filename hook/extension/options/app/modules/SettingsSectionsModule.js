            optionHtml: '<strong style="font-size: 18px; color: #fc4c02;">Estimated Normalized Power:</strong><br /><br />The "Estimated Normalized Power" is a better statistic to "Estimated Average Power" given by Strava. Why? While average power simply takes all of the samples of "Estimated Power" and divides them by the number of samples, Normalized Power uses a tricky weighting system to come up with a number that is more in line with the true physiological effort for your given activity.<br/><br/>"Estimated Normalized Power" is basically the power that you could have maintainted for the same physiological "cost" if your power output had been constant.<br/><br/>"Estimated Normalized Power" is calculated from an algorithm introduced by Dr. Andy Coggan to weight this variability according to its physiological difficulty. Here\'s the formula: <br/><br/><img src="img/np_equation.png" /><br /><br /><strong style="font-size: 18px; color: #fc4c02;">Estimated Variability Index:</strong><br /><br />Variability Index is an indication of how your activity was paced. This indication shows how smooth or evenly paced the power output was during a race or work out. Basically Estimated Variability Index is Estimated Normalized Power over Average watts<br /><br /><strong style="font-size: 18px; color: #fc4c02;">Estimated Intensity Factor:</strong><br /><br />Although normalized power is a better measure of training intensity than average power, it does not take into account differences in fitness within or between individuals. Therefore StravaPlus introduce an intensity factor (IF) for every activity. IF is simply the ratio of the estimated normalized power as described above to your Functional Threshold Power (FTP) (entered in settings page). For example, if your estimated normalized power for a long training ride done early in the year is 210 W and your threshold power at the time is 280 W, then the IF for that workout would be 0.75. However, if you did that same exact ride later in the year after your threshold power had risen to 300 W, then the IF would be lower, i.e., 0.70. IF therefore provides a valid and convenient way of comparing the relative intensity of a training session or race either within or between riders, taking into account changes or differences in threshold power.<br/><br/>Typical IF values for various training sessions or races are as follows:<br/><br/><span style="font-size: 14px;">&#8226; Less than 0.75 recovery rides<br/>&#8226; 0.75-0.85 endurance-paced training rides<br/>&#8226; 0.85-0.95 tempo rides, aerobic and anaerobic interval workouts (work and rest periods combined), longer (>2.5 h) road races<br/>&#8226; 0.95-1.05 lactate threshold intervals (work period only), shorter (<2.5 h) road races, criteriums, circuit races, longer (e.g., 40 km) TTs<br/>&#8226; 1.05-1.15 shorter (e.g., 15 km) TTs, track points race<br/>&#8226; Greater than 1.15 prologue TT, track pursuit, track miss-and-out</span><br /><br /><strong style="font-size: 18px; color: #fc4c02;">Normalized Watts / Kg:</strong><br /><br />"Normalized Watts / Kg" is basically an estimation of the power per Killogram that you could have maintainted for the same physiological "cost" if your power output had been constant<br/></br>That\'s simply your "Estimated Normalized Power" over your weight in Kg. <br/> <br/><strong style="font-size: 18px; color: #fc4c02;">Quartiles and median</strong> <br/> <br/>For understanding these indicators, we assume that 0% to 100% are all the heart rates sorted ascending you obtained during an activity. <br/> <br/> <strong>25% Quartile:</strong>This indicator represents the power you maintained at the position "25%". This is commonly called "Lower quartile" or Q1. <br/> <br/> <strong>50% Median:</strong>This indicator represents the power you maintained at the position "50%". It\'s simply the median... <br/> <br/> <strong>75% Quartile:</strong>This indicator represents the power you maintained at the position "75%". This is commonly called "Upper quartile" or Q3. <br/> <br/> <br/><i>These indicators can be more meaningfull than average power itself to analyse activity power. For example, you upload an activity in which you ride pretty fast for a long time. Then, you expect to have a good average power. Unfortunately, you have to go through the city to go home where many red lights and cars behavior slow you down. Your average power then drops very quickly and do not highlight your effort of "riding with power". In this example, the 75% quartile power is representative of the effort you made (eliminating low power associated with the cross of the city).</i> <br/> <br/> <br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile" target="_blank">Understand lower quartile, median and upper quartile here</a> </div>',

The longer you ride at full throttle, the more you SCORE!! So go outside and suffer for twelve hours! Or stay here to understand what it returns... <i>TRIMP</i> is a way to model the human athletic performance. This concept has been introduced by Dr. Eric Banister. <br/> <br/>Ok, Cool... But how does this work?! <br/> <br/>StravaPlus computes <i>TRIMP</i> on activities using the more sophisticated approach: <i>TRIMP Exponental Heart Rate Scaling</i> which uses your <i>Heart Rate Reserve or HRR</i>. <i>HRR</i> is basically your heart effort level according to your heart capacity . <br/> <br/>What are all these terms?! Don\'t panic... Here is an explanation from a Math view (you may hate that, sorry...). <br/> <br/> <img src="img/trimp_equation.png" /> <br/> <br/>Where&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="img/kMen_equation.png" />&nbsp;&nbsp;(For Men) &nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="img/kWomen_equation.png" />&nbsp;&nbsp;(For Women) <br/> <br/>And <i>HRR = Heart Rate Reserve = Heart effort level according to heart capacity</i> defined by <br/> <br/> <img src="img/hrr_equation.png" /> <br/> <br/>According this <i>TRIMP Exponental Heart Rate Scaling</i> formula, the longer you ride at full throttle, the more you SCORE! <br/> <br/>But this heart score seems to be <i>Strava Suffer Score</i>?! Not really... <i>Strava Suffer Score</i> is only inspired by the TRIMP concept. However the idea is the same and both scores are correlated. <br/> <br/>Need more info? Then read more about <a href="http://fellrnr.com/wiki/Heart_Rate_Reserve" target="_blank">HRR here</a> and <a href="http://fellrnr.com/wiki/TRIMP" target="_blank">TRIMP here</a>. <br/> <br/> <strong style="font-size: 18px; color: #fc4c02;">%Heart Rate Reserve Average</strong> <i>(Displayed if you are the activity athlete)</i> <br/> <br/>Represents the stress level reached during an activity according to your heart capacity.

It\'s impossible... But try to get the higher percentage ;) You will get a better <i>TRIMP</i> score in the same way. <br/> <br/> <strong style="font-size: 18px; color: #fc4c02;">%Heart Rate Reserve Octo Zones Distribution in minutes</strong> <i>(Displayed if you are the activity athlete)</i><br/> <br/>To display this graph you need heart rate data on your activity.
